# PicoW-Multiple-SSIDs
Add multiple SSID's to wifi_credentials.json, run multiple_ssids.py and it will try to connect to one of the SSIDs in the json file.
If it finds a SSID and succesfully connects, the onboard LED turnes on. 

Run this in a main.py and when booting up, it will automatically run and connect. Great when not wanting to implement a wifi-manager GUI on the pico.
